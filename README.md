A health utility tool that calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user weight and height. It provides instant feedback and health categorization according to standard WHO ranges.

## ✨ Features
- **Accurate Calculation:** Uses the metric formula for BMI calculation.
- **Dynamic Categorization:** Automatically classifies results into Underweight, Normal, Overweight, or Obese.
- **Color-Coded Results:** Status text changes color based on the health category for better UX.
- **Input Validation:** Ensures only positive numeric values are processed.

## 🛠️ Technical Focus
- **Floating Point Math:** Using `parseFloat()` and `.toFixed(1)` to handle decimal precision.
- **Conditional Formatting:** Mapping specific ranges of numeric values to UI styles and text.
- **Responsive Design:** A clean, card-based layout suitable for mobile and desktop.

## 🧠 BCA Concept Highlight
This project demonstrates **Data Interpretation**. It shows how to translate raw numeric data (BMI score) into meaningful information (Health Status) using range-based conditional statements.
